        Chandrayaan-3's landing had been carefully planned to coincide with the start of a lunar day, which equals a
        little over four weeks on Earth. Isro had said this would allow the lander and the rover 14 days of sunlight to
        charge their batteries and work. It has now said that both have completed all their assignments. Initially, Isro
        had said that once night fell - which also equals two weeks on Earth - the lander and the rover would stop
        working. But scientists say it is possible that they will come back to life when the next lunar day starts. For
        instance, China's Chang'e4 lander and Yutu2 rover woke up several times with the sunrise. So, hoping that Vikram
        and Pragyaan would also wake up when a new day breaks, Isro officials have prepared them for the night - their
        batteries have been fully charged, all their scientific instruments have been turned off and they are now
        "safely parked in sleep mode".
